# Tutorial to discuss reproducible research using `markdown`, `knitr` and version control using git & github

As we discussed and demonstrated in class on thursday, there are two major pieces to this.

1. Version Control
2. Making your research reproducible.

## Version Control.

Since we already discussed the basics of version control, I will not go over it again in too much detail. There is a nice, gentle introduction  at [software carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/v5/novice/git/index.html) that I recommend you go through.

Basically it allows you to keep track of all of the "versions" of your scripts (or any other text files). Simply by *committing* your changes to your scripts using version control, all of the changes you made (and when you made them) are kept track of. You can 'undo' changes in the scripts as well. It is also extremely useful if you are working collaboratively on scripts (or on manusscripts).

We will be using [`git`](http://git-scm.com/) as our version control system (Another popular one that you can use in Rstudio is *subversion* or *svn*). There are many tutorials out there to introduce git (including the software carpentry one above). I think [github does a good job to get started](https://help.github.com/).
